### 2. Scripts for obtaining log2 profiles and enrichment domains estimated using BioHMM algorithm
These scripts work with outputs from HTSeq-count, make sure you added info about your files in `damid_description.csv` file.

Please open `DamID-seq_analysis.R` script, set parameters that suit your DamID-analyst's needs best and launch it.

**Output**: log2 profiles of Dam/Dam-POI (Protein of interest) in csv and bedgraph forms, HMM domains in bed format and some statistics.
